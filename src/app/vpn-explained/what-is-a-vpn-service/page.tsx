          secure communication without needing physical cables. They allow
          multiple devices to work together seamlessly, maintaining a secure and
          established link. This is particularly useful for businesses and
          individuals who need to ensure that their internet activities remain
          confidential and protected from external threats.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding VPN functionality is essential. VPNs create a
          point-to-point tunnel between virtual private networks, encapsulating
          and encrypting user data to ensure secure connections over potentially
          insecure networks. This makes them invaluable for enhancing online
