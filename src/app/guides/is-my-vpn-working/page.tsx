                    effective tools for achieving this is a Virtual Private Network (VPN). However, simply having a VPN isn’t enough—you
                    need to ensure it’s working correctly. Using a VPN app to check the status and functionality of your VPN connection
                    can help verify if it is active and effectively securing your connection. This blog post will guide you through the
                    essential steps to check if your VPN is functioning as it should, so you can surf the web with peace of mind.</p>
                <h2>Understanding the Importance of VPN Functionality</h2>
                <p>A VPN enhances your online privacy and security by encrypting your internet connection and masking your IP address.
                    This prevents hackers, ISPs, and even government agencies from tracking your online activities. But what good is a
                    VPN if it’s not working correctly? Regularly checking your VPN ensures that your data remains secure and your
                    privacy intact. Additionally, ensuring that your VPN uses proper DNS server configurations is crucial to prevent DNS
                    leaks, which can expose your browsing information and location, leading to potential risks such as data logging by
                    ISPs and DNS hijacking attacks.</p>
                <h3>1. Verify Your IP Address</h3>
                <h4>Check Your IP Address Without VPN</h4>
                <p>Before connecting to your VPN, it’s essential to know your real IP address. Websites like <Link
                    rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://WhatIsMyIP.com">WhatIsMyIP.com</Link> can show you your current IP address.
                    This step provides a baseline to compare against after connecting to the VPN.</p>
                <h4>Check Your IP Address With VPN</h4>
                <p>Once you’re connected to your VPN, revisit <Link rel="noopener noreferrer"
                    href="http://WhatIsMyIP.com">WhatIsMyIP.com</Link> or similar sites to confirm that your IP address has changed to
                    the IP assigned by the VPN server. If your IP address remains the same, your VPN may not be functioning correctly.
                </p>
                <p>Preventing IP address leaks is crucial for maintaining online security and privacy. You can detect potential leaks
                    using built-in tools from VPN applications or external websites, and address them by adjusting your VPN settings.
